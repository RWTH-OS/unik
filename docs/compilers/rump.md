# Rumprun Unikernels

UniK uses Rumprun as a platform for compiling Go and C++ to unikernels.

---

### Golang
Compiling Go on the rumprun platform requires the following parameters be met:
* **Go** installed and your `$GOPATH` configured (see [getting started with Go](https://golang.org/doc/install))
* Your project should be located within your system's `$GOPATH` (if you're unfamiliar with Go and the `$GOPATH` convention, read more [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7970390/what-should-be-the-values-of-gopath-and-goroot))
* One `main` package in the root directory of your project
* [Godeps](https://github.com/tools/godep) installed (run `go get github.com/tools/godep` once Go is installed)
* Run `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1 godep save ./...` from the root of your project. This will create a `Godeps/Godeps.json` file as well as place all dependencies of your project in the `./vendor` directory. This will allow UniK to compile your application entirely using only the root directory of your project.

---

### Node.js
Compiling Nodejs applications on rumprun requires the following parameters be met:
* One "main" file somewhere in your project
* All dependencies already installed to `node_modules` with `npm install `
* A configuration file named `manifest.yaml` in the root directory of your project.
  * the `manifest.yaml` file should contain a single line of text like so:
    ```yaml
    main_file: YOUR_MAIN_FILE.js
    runtime_args: "optional string of node arguments"
    ```
    where you replace `YOUR_MAIN_FILE.js` with the relative path to your main file from the root directory of your project.

    for example, if your project has the following structure:
    ```
    $ tree myproject/
    ./myproject/
    ├── manifest.yaml
    ├── node_modules
    │   └── httpdispatcher
    │       ├── README.md
    │       ├── httpdispatcher.js
    │       ├── node_modules
    │       │   └── mime
    │       │       ├── LICENSE
    │       │       ├── README.md
    │       │       ├── build
    │       │       │   ├── build.js
    │       │       │   └── test.js
    │       │       ├── cli.js
    │       │       ├── mime.js
    │       │       ├── package.json
    │       │       └── types.json
    │       └── package.json
    └── server.js
    ```
    your `manifest.yaml` should read:
    ```yaml
    main_file: server.js
    ```
    or
    ```yaml
    main_file: ./server.js
    ```

    and runtime_args is an optional string of options to pass to the node interpreter

    See [example node project](../examples/example-nodejs-app) for an example of what a Node.js project should look like.

### Python 3


Compiling Python applications on rumprun requires the following parameters be met:
* One "main" file somewhere in your project
* All dependencies installed locally to the root directory of your project.
  * This can be done by running the following command for each module your project depends on:
    ```
    pip install --install-option="--prefix=<PATH_TO_PROJECT_ROOT>" --ignore-installed <MODULE_NAME>
    ```
* A configuration file named `manifest.yaml` in the root directory of your project.
  * the `manifest.yaml` file should contain a single line of text like so:
    ```yaml
    main_file: YOUR_MAIN_FILE.py
    runtime_args: "optional string of python runtime arguments"
    ```
    where you replace `YOUR_MAIN_FILE.py` with the relative path to your main file from the root directory of your project.

    for example, if your project has the following structure:
    ```
    $ tree myproject/
    .
    ├── bin
    │   └── bottle.py
    ├── lib
    │   └── python3.5
    │       └── site-packages
    │           ├── __pycache__
    │           │   └── bottle.cpython-35.pyc
    │           ├── bottle-0.12.9-py3.5.egg-info
    │           │   ├── PKG-INFO
    │           │   ├── SOURCES.txt
    │           │   ├── dependency_links.txt
    │           │   ├── installed-files.txt
    │           │   └── top_level.txt
    │           └── bottle.py
    ├── manifest.yaml
    └── server.py
    ```
    your `manifest.yaml` should read:
    ```yaml
    main_file: server.py
    ```
    or
    ```yaml
    main_file: ./server.py
    ```

    and runtime_args is an optional string of options to pass to the python interpreter

    See [example python project](../examples/example-python3-httpd) for an example of what a Python3 project should look like.

### Java

Compiling Java applications on rumprun requires the following parameters to be met:
* Application compiled to a fat `.jar` or `.war` file
* A configuration file named `manifest.yaml` in the root directory of your project.
  * the `manifest.yaml` file should contain a single line of text like so:
  ```yaml
  main_file: PATH_TO_MAIN_JAR.jar
  runtime_args: "optional string of JVM arguments"
  ```
  where PATH_TO_MAIN_JAR.jar is the path to your main .jar or .war file relative to the project directory

  and runtime_args is an optional string of arguments to pass to the JVM at runtime. Useful for setting properties and other language-level arguments.

### C/C++

C/C++ support coming soon!
